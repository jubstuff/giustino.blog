People do things, not job roles

I read a lot of posts about how a product designer does this while a UX designer can’t do that, and certainly, a software engineer shouldn’t do it. Are you crazy?!

I’d like to remind these gatekeepers of the Truth™️ that the topics we love and discuss about predate any standardization.

Also, we have to thank hackers, HCI experts and engineers that went above and beyond their job description and helped jumpstart the digital design field.

Let’s stop gatekeeping and start bringing value to our users. Regardless of our job description!
