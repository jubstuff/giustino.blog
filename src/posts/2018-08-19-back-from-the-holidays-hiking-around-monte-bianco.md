When I was younger, I usually went hiking with my dad.

He had one of those hiking guides that lists all the walks in a certain region; I still remember the name: &#8220;Il Cammina Campania. Guida WWF&#8221;.

I have wonderful memories of those walks: the early wake-up, me sleeping in the car, the 4+ hours of walking, collecting dead branches to create our very walking sticks&#8230;

Since then, though, I didn&#8217;t hike so much. Just some random walks in nearby parks, or something like that.

So when I and Valeria were planning our holidays I asked her if she&#8217;d like spending a week walking around the mountains. And she said yes!

**It was great! **

I feel so refreshed and full of energy, that I&#8217;m asking myself how I&#8217;ve survived without this for all of these years.
