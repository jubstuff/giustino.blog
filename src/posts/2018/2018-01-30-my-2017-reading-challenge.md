Last year I decided that [I wanted to read more][1]. So I set myself a goal to read 53 books in one year. [I failed][2] (That&#8217;s a recurring theme).

During the challenge, that started the 31st of October 2016, I managed to read ~25 books. Here they are:

  1. [Intercom on Product Management][3] _Great book_
  2. [Docker for Developers][4] _meh_
  3. [Liminal Thinking: Create the Change You Want by Changing the Way You Think][5] _I need to read this again_
  4. [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts][6] _Lot of insights_
  5. [Modernizing Legacy Applications in PHP][7] _Really well written_
  6. [Digital Marketing For Dummies][8] _I don&#8217;t usually read marketing books, but this is good_
  7. [La luna e i falÃ²][9] _A Masterpiece_
  8. [Alice in Wonderland][10] _A classic_
  9. [Contagious: Why Things Catch On][11] _You need to read this!_
 10. [Warren Buffett Style: Regola n.1 non perdere mai denaro][12] _What was I thinking? Awful_
 11. [Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action][13] _Maybe I need to re-read this. I didn&#8217;t like it_
 12. [The Time Machine][14] _Wow!_
 13. [The War of the Worlds][15] _Slow, but good_
 14. [Demystifying Public Speaking][16] _A good piece on the topic_
 15. [The Digital Photography Book 1][17] _Sometime you need to move on_
 16. [Blockchain Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction in 25 Steps][18] _To understand what was it all about_
 17. [The Principles of Successful Freelancing][19] _I had the idea to start freelancing_
 18. [The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC Book for Digital Photographers][20] _I like retouching photos_
 19. [The Minimalist Photographer][21] _And also travel light_
 20. [The Best of The Digital Photography Book Series][22] _Same as above_
 21. [Travel and Street Photography: From Snapshots to Great Shots][23] _And travel_
 22. [Beyond Legacy Code][24] _A nice read_
 23. [Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests][25] _If you&#8217;re into testing, you should read this book_
 24. [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills][26] _Very basic, but if you need an introduction, it&#8217;s perfect_
 25. [The Little Black Book of Decision Making: Making Complex Decisions with Confidence in a Fast-Moving World][27] _I really loved this book: it&#8217;s packed with knowledge_

So I&#8217;ve read less than half my goal but, jokes aside, I don&#8217;t consider it a failure. I&#8217;ve read more in 2017 than in the previous two years!

## Tips to read more

Social media has taken a toll on everyone. I discovered myself more than I like to admit browsing endlessly streams of jokes, links, articles (_I&#8217;ll just save it and read it later&#8230;yeah sure_), tweets, photos and so on. But I also discovered that I could just stop. I trained myself to stop being a social media zombie and read instead.

Everyone imagines that to read you have to be sitting on your favorite couch, beside a fireplace, drinking hot chocolate while outside the snow falls covering the ground. How romantic. Yes, there are situations like this and they happen in the movies. We live in the harsh reality, we should be _guerrilla readers_.

The trick is: **read everywhere**, even if a single page or paragraph. In a queue? Read. Waiting for the doctor? Read. Stuck in traffic? Listen to an audiobook. To the dentist? **Run**! ðŸ˜€

My friends know that I swear by [Safari Books Online][28]: the thing that I like the most is that it enables me to access and download all the books on my smartphone, so that I don&#8217;t need to bring with me yet another device (_I&#8217;m looking at you, Kindle. It was nice, but you know that it never worked between us_)

## 2018 edition

So have I stopped? Of course not. But only stupids don&#8217;t learn from their mistakes.

So for this year I&#8217;ve decided to start from January to December (so that I can [track my results][29] in Goodreads better). And since I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ll be able to read a book a week, I&#8217;ve decreased the target to 40 books. That&#8217;s a bit more than last year.

So, are you up to a challenge? [Connect with me on Goodreads][30]
