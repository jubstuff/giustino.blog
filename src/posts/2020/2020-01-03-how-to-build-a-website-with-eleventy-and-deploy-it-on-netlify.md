    Static sites are getting very popular, and for a good reason: they are performant and you can build one for free.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is a new static site generator that you can use to build a website and host it on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. The great thing about 11ty (as it's also called) is that it's very lightweight and doesn't impose you anything. You can decide your folder structure, libraries, and way of doing things.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this post I&#8217;m going to show you how to build a (simple) website with Eleventy and deploy it on Netlify.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Prerequisites
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    I will assume you have:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Node.js 12.18.0 installed
    </li>
    <li>
      A little knowledge about JavaScript and its environment (npm, npm scripts)
    </li>
    <li>
      Git installed and a little knowledge about how to setup a git repository, switching branch, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      A little terminal knowledge
    </li>
    <li>
      A code editor installed. I will use Visual Studio Code, but you can use whatever you like
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>
    Commit often
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    I suggest you to commit often, to keep track of the changes you&#8217;re making. Whenever you see this symbol, I&#8217;m making a git commit ✅.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Installation
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    To install Eleventy, create a folder <code>eleventy-playground</code>
  </p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-jsx">mkdir eleventy-playground && cd eleventy-playground
</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    Create a <code>package.json</code> file
  </p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-bash">npm init -y
</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    Then install eleventy
  </p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy
</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    That&#8217;s it.
  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Project setup
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Then open the project in your editor
  </p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-bash">code .
</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    Before going forward, now it&#8217;s a good moment to initialize our git repository
  </p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-bash">git init .
</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    And create a <code>.gitignore</code> file to exclude the <code>node_modules</code> folder ✅
  </p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-bash">touch .gitignore
</code></pre>
  
  <pre><code># .gitignore file
node_modules/
</code></pre>
  
  <h2>
    Creating and deploying your first website with 11ty
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Now&#8217;s the moment to build and deploy our first (even if super-simple) website.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When solving complex problems I usually try to connect all the dots with the most simple version of the problem. (This is what Nat Pryce and Steve Freeman authors of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627">Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests</a> call Walking Skeleton).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So our plan is this:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Create a one-page website with eleventy
    </li>
    <li>
      Deploy it on Netlify
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Once we have the deploy pipeline for this simple website, we will simply evolve it, deploying continuously without having to worry. Let&#8217;s start
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Create a file <code>index.md</code> in the root folder
  </p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-bash">touch index.md
</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    Then, add some content to it ✅
  </p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-markdown"># My website

This is my website, built with Eleventy.
</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    Let&#8217;s see our masterpiece. Run this command in your terminal
  </p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-bash">npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    This will compile your website and run a local server for you. By default Eleventy stores all the website files in a folder named <code>_site</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should see something similar in your terminal:
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Just click on the Local link and voilà, here&#8217;s your first website built with Eleventy!
  </p>
  
  <p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    It&#8217;s not fancy, but it works. I always follow <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">this principle</a> when working:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make it work
    </li>
    <li>
      Make it right
    </li>
    <li>
      Make it fast
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Now let&#8217;s deploy this website and make it public.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We&#8217;ll use Netlify to host all of our websites. Create an account, and just after that you&#8217;ll see this dashboard
  </p>
  
  <p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    See the drop zone? That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re going to drag and drop our website files. Like this
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <h2>
    Conclusion
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Once finished, Netlify should show you a URL like this <a href="https://vibrant-shockley-4733f1.netlify.app/">https://vibrant-shockley-4733f1.netlify.app/</a> with your finished website. Congratulations!
