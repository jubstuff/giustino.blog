I told myself I would publish this post as soon as the situation would be back to normal. But since I don't know when it will happen, I decided to publish and let it go.

March 13th was my last day of work as an employee: I decided to create a company with [Giuseppe][1].

I told the news to several people before writing it here. They all wished me well and said, "it will be more difficult than you think, be careful; you never know what to expect when you are an entrepreneur".

Now, I tried to imagine various possible scenarios. 
For example, I told myself that if this initiative wouldn't get traction in a year, I could have quickly found work as an engineer again, and so on.

Of course, I assure you, none of those scenarios was a once-in-a-century global pandemic.

So here I am, after a jump that I thought was calculated, and instead, it was higher than I thought.

Clearly we have not yet managed to set up the company, since it is not wise to venture to a notary these days, so the adventure looks interesting right away! ðŸ’ª

## What I will do?

At the moment, we are in the definition phase, but what I can say is that we will deal with Product Design, or User Experience and User Interface of digital products.

We will not do development, but we will have a more supportive role for the dev teams.

I know this sounds weird since I'm an engineer, but I've always said that coding was both my hobby and my job. 

I'll become a developer who designs, and I'll learn how to be an entrepreneur (which does not seem like small stuff to me: those who know me can imagine me immersed in a crazy and desperate study with a thousand and thousand open tabs and books on books on books ... on books).

## What are you doing now that everything is blocked?

Well, actually, what we are experiencing would not seem the best time to start a company (or in general to make long-term projects). But maybe not too.

In the sense that, in this somewhat surreal period, we are dedicating ourselves to a whole series of things that I think we would have overlooked if we had been caught up in the whirlwind of orders and customers in a "normal" moment.

Things like defining the company's Mission and Vision, establishing the flow of internal and external processes, studying how others have carried out their agencies, working on sales collateral and preparing the site, and thinking about the Customer Value Journey. These are just a few of the activities in which we are engaging these days.

And then I'm going to resume writing here.

In the last six years, I have gone from being the only developer of a small startup to being one of 15 developers, to being an engineering manager of various teams of different sizes and skills, and I would like to share the things I have learned along this journey.

In short, this year promises to be challenging, but I think I'll learn a lot: I'm already taking notes for my TED talk "I started a company during a pandemic and survived" ðŸ˜…
