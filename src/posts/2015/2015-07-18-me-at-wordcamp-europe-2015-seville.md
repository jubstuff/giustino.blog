Two weeks ago I attended WordCamp Europe 2015 and it was truly an amazing experience. This was my second WordCamp (I was in Sofia last year).

## Seville

Seville was hot! Trust me, I&#8217;m from Naples, Italy, and I know what does it mean when it gets hot in Summer. But Seville&#8230;as the taxi driver said: &#8220;No June, no July, no August, no September..you should come any other month!&#8221;

But it&#8217;s truly a wonderful city: one morning I got up early just to get lost walking through the streets.

## The WordCamp

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1099" src="https://i0.wp.com/v1.giustino.blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordcamp-seville-2015-1024x768.jpg?resize=660%2C495" alt="wordcamp seville 2015" width="660" height="495" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/v1.giustino.blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordcamp-seville-2015.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/v1.giustino.blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordcamp-seville-2015.jpg?resize=300%2C225&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/v1.giustino.blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordcamp-seville-2015.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/v1.giustino.blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wordcamp-seville-2015.jpg?w=2200&ssl=1 2200w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> There is just one word: **amazing**. The organization was just perfect: two tracks well-balanced, talks ranging all the spectrum, the food was tasty.

But the real value in this kind of (non)conferences is in the people. Don&#8217;t go to these events and stay on your own. Talk to the people, try to understand what they do, listen to their experiences and I guarantee that you will return home changed. Among developers and the organizers (thanks, all of you!) I talked, for example, to a retired Australian man who was passing by Seville and used WordPress to help charity associations with their websites!

## The Community or &#8220;Go Italy, Go!&#8221;

Before this event, the Italian WordPress scene wasn&#8217;t in a good shape. But there were a lot of Italians in Seville. So we gathered, talked, and asked for suggestions. Then we planned and:

  * we have now a rebooted [Rosetta Site][1]<sup id="fnref-1066-1"><a href="#fn-1066-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, with a brand new showcase and lots of improvements coming by;</p> 
  * [the blog][2] is also rocking, with many news about WordPress being translated in Italian;

  * new WordPress meetups are popping around Italy: we have [Barletta][3], [Bologna][4], [Lucera][5], [Milano][6], Napoli, [Roma][7], [Romagna][8], [Torino][9] and [Brescia][10];

  * and finally, a [Slack][11] channel has been created, where everyone can contribute to the Italian WordPress scene.

## A new hope

This was my experience at WordCamp Europe 2015. Lots of things happened in a short amount of time, but I&#8217;m sure that this year will bring more and more. Stay tuned!
