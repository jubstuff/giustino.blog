I don&#8217;t remember the very first time I chose WordPress. As a reference, this was the Edit Post screen at that time.

I went from being a theme developer to being a **plugin developer** and many things have changed since then, but WordPress remains my main interest.

Lately, **[I&#8217;ve][1] [begun][2] [contributing][3] [to the][4] [open source][5] project**. My goal is one day to become a Core contributor.

Currently, I am:

  * Core Contributor
  * Co-organizer for the [WordPress Meetup Milano][6]
  * Translation Editor for the Italian language
  * Moderator on the [Italian WordPress.org forum][7]
